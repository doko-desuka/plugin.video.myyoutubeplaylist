# My Youtube Playlist 0.1.0
Using the YouTube add-on (plugin.video.youtube), it shows an item pointing to a custom YouTube playlist so you can play it or add it to your Favourites, without having to login.  
Just change the playlist ID inside the **default.py** script to use your own playlist. Then pack it back into a ZIP, transfer to your Kodi device and [install it](https://kodi.wiki/view/HOW-TO:Install_add-ons_from_zip_files).

I recommend keeping your YT playlist as "unlisted" so that only you know about it, like this:
