# My Youtube Playlist 0.1.0
Using the YouTube add-on (plugin.video.youtube), this add-on shows a single item: it points to a custom YouTube playlist so you can play it or add it to your Favourites.
Download the zip and extract the folder inside to some place. Open **default.py** (read that script for more info) from inside that folder, and paste the ID of the playlist you want to watch inside that script.  
Pack the entire folder back into a zip just like it was before, transfer to your Kodi device and install it there ([Kodi docs](https://kodi.wiki/view/HOW-TO:Install_add-ons_from_zip_files).

I recommend keeping your YT playlist as "unlisted" so that only you know about it, like this:
![playlist settings](https://images2.imgbox.com/c8/19/rz1jW6aT_o.png)  
Then add videos to it on YouTube and watch them later in Kodi.
